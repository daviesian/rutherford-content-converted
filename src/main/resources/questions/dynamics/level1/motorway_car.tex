\begin{problem}[Robin1]
{A car driving along the motorway accelerates and doubles its speed. The momentum and kinetic energy of the car respectively increase by a factor of
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Momentum \stress{4} \quad : \quad Kinetic Energy \stress{4}
	\item Momentum \stress{4} \quad : \quad Kinetic Energy \stress{2} 
	\item Momentum \stress{2} \quad : \quad Kinetic Energy \stress{2}
	\item Momentum \stress{2} \quad : \quad Kinetic Energy \stress{4} \answer
	\item Momentum \stress{1} \quad : \quad Kinetic Energy \stress{1}
\end{enumerate}
}
{\stress{Question by RWH}}
{The correct answer is (d).  The momentum of an object is proportional to its speed, \vari{v}, but the kinetic energy depends on \vari{v^2}.  So if we double the speed the momentum doubles but the kinetic energy goes up by a factor of 4.}
