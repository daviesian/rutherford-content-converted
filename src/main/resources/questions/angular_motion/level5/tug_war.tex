Two people are playing the game ``rotational tug of war". This involves two players at either end of a rod of mass \valuedef{m}{500}{kg} and length \valuedef{l}{5}{m} pivoted about its centre (which is fixed in the ground), both pulling as hard as they can, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:AngularMotion_tug} above. You win the game if you rotate the rod by an angle of \quantity{180}{^{\circ}}.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \question[a]{Player 1 exerts a force of constant magnitude \valuedef{F_1}{300}{N}, whilst player 2 exerts a force of constant magnitude \valuedef{F_2}{350}{N}. Find how long it takes player 2 to win.} 
\item \question[b]{For the next game player 3 joins in, and exerts a force of constant magnitude of \valuedef{F_3}{150}{N} whilst standing halfway between the centre of the rod and player 1. Find out whether players 1 and 3 win this time or player 2 wins again, and how long this game takes.}

{\answer[a]{\valuedef{t}{5.1}{s}}
\answer[b]{\valuedef{t}{7.2}{s}}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The net moment on the rod, in the anti-clockwise direction, is given by 
\begin{equation*}
F_1l-F_2l=I\ddot\theta
\end{equation*}
The moment of inertia of a rod about its centre is $\frac{1}{12}ml^2$, as calculated earlier in the sheet. Therefore
\begin{align*}
F_1l-F_2l&=\frac{1}{12}ml^2\ddot\theta \\
\Rightarrow \ddot\theta&=\frac{12(F_2-F_1)}{ml}
\end{align*}
Now by analogy with the linear suvat equation $s=ut+\frac{1}{2}at^2$, we can form an equation to give the total angle rotated through:
\begin{equation*}
\theta=\omega_0t+\frac{1}{2}\ddot\theta t^2
\end{equation*}
Since the initial angular speed $\omega_0$ is zero, we can calculate $t$ directly:
\begin{align*}
\theta&=\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{12(F_1-F_2)}{ml}t^2 \\
\Rightarrow t^2&=\frac{ml\theta}{6(F_1-F_2)}
\end{align*}
Since $F_2>F_1$,  player 2 will win and we want the time it takes to reach $\theta=-\pi$ radians, so the final answer becomes
\begin{equation*}
t=\sqrt{\frac{-ml\pi}{6(F_1-F_2)}}=5.1\textrm{ s}
\end{equation*}
\item In this case the net torque on the rod in the clockwise direction is 
\begin{equation*}
F_1l+F_3l/2-F_2l=I\ddot\theta
\end{equation*}
Evaluating this gives a positive acceleration in the anti-clockwise direction, so this time players 1 and 3 will win. Using the exact same argument as in part a) but realising it will now reach an angle $+\pi$ radians, we find that the time taken is 
\begin{align*}
t=\sqrt{\frac{ml\pi}{6(F_1+F_3/2-F_2)}}=7.2\textrm{ s}
\end{align*}
\end{enumerate}
