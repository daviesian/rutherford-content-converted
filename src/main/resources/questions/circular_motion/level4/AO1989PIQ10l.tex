\begin{problem}[AO1989PIQ10l] 
{When a particle travels in a circle of radius $r$ with constant speed $v$, its acceleration is:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $\frac{v^{2}}{r}$ towards the centre.
	\item $\frac{v^{2}}{r}$ away from the centre.
	\item zero
	\item $rv^{2}$ towards the centre.
	\item $rv^{2}$ away from the centre.
\end{enumerate}}

{The correct answer is (a). The centripetal force required to keep an object moving at a constant velocity in a circle is $\frac{mv^{2}}{r}$ towards the centre and so Newton's Second Law, $\vtr{F} = m\vtr{a}$ says that the acceleration must therefore be $\frac{v^{2}}{r}$, towards the centre also since $\vtr{F}$ and $\vtr{a}$ must lie in the same direction.}
