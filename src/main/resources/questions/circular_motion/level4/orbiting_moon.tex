\begin{problem}[IntA1988PIIQ3l]
{Find the speed of a satellite in a circular orbit around the Moon, very near the Moon's surface. What is the kinetic energy per unit mass of the satellite?
The gravitational force \vari{F_{A}} between the satellite and the Moon is in the inward radial direction and its magnitude is given by the equation 
\begin{equation*}
F_A=GMm/R^2
\end{equation*}
where \vari{G} is the gravitational constant; \vari{M} and \vari{m} are the masses of the Moon and the satellite respectively; and \vari{R} is the radius of the orbit. Give your answer to two decimal places.

\emph{Hint:} The radius of the Moon is \quantity{1.74\times 10^6}{m}, the mass of the Moon is \quantity{7.35\times 10\sup{22}}{kg} and Newton's Gravitational Constant, \valuedef{G}{6.67 \times 10^{-11}}{N\,m\sup{2}\,kg\sup{-2}}.}

{In order to perform circular motion the magnitude of the gravitational force \vari{F_g} in the inward radial direction, 
\begin{equation*} F_g=GMm/R^2 \end{equation*}
must be equal to the magnitude of the centripetal force $F_c$ given by 
\begin{equation*} F_c=mv^2/R \end{equation*}
where \vari{M} is the mass of the moon, \vari{m} is the mass of the satellite, \vari{R} is the radius of the orbit (equal to the radius of the moon) and \vari{v} is the speed of the satellite. Setting the two expressions equal to each other gives
\begin{align*} GMm/R^2=mv^2/R \\ \Rightarrow v^2=GM/R \end{align*}
Therefore the speed is \vari{v} = \valuedef{\sqrt{GM/R}}{1.68}{km\,s\sup{-1}}
%and the kinetic energy per unit mass is \begin{equation*} \frac{1}{2}v^2=GM/2R=1.41\times 10^6\textrm{ J kg}^{-1} \end{equation*}
