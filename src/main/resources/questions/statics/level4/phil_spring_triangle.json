The loose ends of the springs are attached to each other at a point C and in this framework the springs are just taut. It is found that the angle made by one of the springs to the vertical \n$\\alpha = 45^{\\circ }$\n. A metal ball is then suspended from the springs at C and the angle made by one of the springs to the vertical is found to be \n$\\beta = 30^{\\circ }$\n.",

    "value": "<p>\nThe correct answer is (b). Initially, the length of the springs is equal to their natural length \n$\\vari{l}$\n. Using trigonometry, \n$l\\sin {\\alpha } = \\frac{d}{2}$\n, so \n$l = \\frac{d}{2\\sin {\\alpha }}$\n. When the mass is suspended from the springs, their length is given by their natural length plus the extension \n$\\vari{x}$\n. The same trig relationship shows that \n$\\left(x+l\\right)\\sin {\\beta } = \\frac{d}{2}$\n; substituting in the expression for \n$\\vari{l}$\n and rearranging gives \n$x = \\frac{d}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sin {\\beta }} - \\frac{1}{\\sin {\\alpha }}\\right)$\n. \n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\nLet \n$\\vari{T}$\n be the tension in one of the springs. Resolving forces vertically on the ball when it is suspended gives \n$mg = 2T\\cos {\\beta }$\n. Hooke&apos;s Law tells us that \n$T = kx$\n, so \n$m = \\frac{2kx\\cos {\\beta }}{g}$\n. Substituting in the expression for \n$\\vari{x}$\n gives \n$m = \\frac{kd\\cos {\\beta }}{g}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sin {\\beta }}-\\frac{1}{\\sin {\\alpha }}\\right)$\n. Substitute the numerical values from the question to obtain the correct answer.\n</p>",
