   "value": "Applying Newton III This law, as Newton stated it, does not always give us all the useful information that we might need. What is implicit within this statement is that for every force there is an equal and opposite force of the \nsame type\n same type . Let us take an example of a cardboard box on the table. \n<br/>\nIn figure \n1\n we have drawn the free-body force diagram for the box and the table on which it sits. If we look at the box alone we can make the mistake of pairing the normal force, \n$\\vari{N}$\n , with the weight of box, \n$\\vari{W_b}$\n . The normal reaction and the weight are \nnot\n not forces of the \nsame type\n same type . The weight of the box is due to the gravitational attraction of the box towards the Earth and the normal reaction (or contact force) is due to the electrostatic forces in the table pushing back on the box. To find a Newton pair of forces we need to look at the free-body diagram for the table \nand\n and the box. The force equal in size and opposite in direction to the normal reaction on the box ( \n$\\vari{N}$\n upwards) is the force of the box pushing atoms apart in the surface of the table ( \n$\\vari{N}$\n downwards). \n<br/>\nNewton&apos;s third law tells us that every force must have a pair so where are the pairs for the weight of the box, \n$\\vari{W_b}$\n , the weight of the table, \n$\\vari{W_t}$\n , and the normal reaction, \n$\\vari{N_E}$\n ? \nFigure \n2\n illustrates that to find the pairs for these forces we need to include the Earth. \n$\\vari{W_b}$\n and \n$\\vari{W_t}$\n are the forces of gravitational attraction of the box and the table towards the Earth. The Earth is attracted to the box (force pointing upwards from the Earth = \n$\\vari{W_b}$\n ) and the Earth is also attracted to the table (force pointing upwards from the Earth = \n$\\vari{W_t}$\n ). \n<br/>\nThe force of gravitational attraction between the box and the table is another pair of forces that we could have added to this diagram but that force is so small that it is usually neglected (essentially zero).",
