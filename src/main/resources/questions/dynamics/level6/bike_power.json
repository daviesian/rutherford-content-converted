   "value": "A cyclist travels along a straight road at speed \n$\\vari{v}$\n on two separate occasions; on Day 1 there is no wind, whereas on Day 2 there is a steady wind blowing at a speed \n$\\vari{w}$\n in a direction perpendicular to the road (i.e. a cross-wind). The force on the cyclist due to air resistance is proportional to the square of the speed of the air relative to the cyclist; as a consequence, to maintain the same constant speed \n$\\vari{v}$\n on Day 2 as on Day 1, the cyclist has to produce a greater power output. In what follows, assume that \n$\\valuedef{v}{20}{km\\,  h\\sup {-1}}$\n and \n$\\valuedef{w}{40}{km\\,  h\\sup {-1}}$",
