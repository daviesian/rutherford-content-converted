\begin{problem}[Robin1]
{A car driving along the motorway accelerates and doubles its speed. The momentum and kinetic energy of the car respectively increase by a factor of
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Momentum \stress{4} \quad : \quad Kinetic Energy \stress{4}
	\item Momentum \stress{4} \quad : \quad Kinetic Energy \stress{2} 
	\item Momentum \stress{2} \quad : \quad Kinetic Energy \stress{2}
	\item Momentum \stress{2} \quad : \quad Kinetic Energy \stress{4} \answer
	\item Momentum \stress{1} \quad : \quad Kinetic Energy \stress{1}
\end{enumerate}
}
{\stress{Question by RWH}}
{The correct answer is (d).  Momentum is mass $\times$ velocity. The direction remains the same, but the size or the magnitude (the speed) is doubled. So the momentum is doubled. \valuedef{KE}{\frac{1}{2}m v^2}{} and if the speed is doubled then speed squared increases by a factor of four. (Remember that the factor is by how much you multiply the original value to get the new value).}
