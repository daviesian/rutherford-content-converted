\begin{problem}[A1989PSIIQ3l] 
{A satellite is to be placed in a circular orbit around the Earth. Use the information and data below to calculate the required radius of the orbit if the satellite is in a geostationary orbit (remains above the same point on the equator). \\ The gravitational force $F_A$ between the satellite and the Earth is in the inward radial direction and its magnitude is given by the equation 
\begin{equation*}
F_A=GMm/R^2
\end{equation*}
where $G$ is the gravitational constant; $M$ and $m$ are the masses of the Earth and the satellite respectively; and $R$ is the radius of the orbit. Please give your answer to two significant figures.

\emph{Hint:} 
\begin{equation*}
G=6.67\times 10^{-11} \textrm{ m}^3\textrm{kg}^{-1}\textrm{s}^{-2}
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
M=5.97\times 10^{24} \textrm{ kg}
\end{equation*}

}{
Use the requirement that in circular motion the magnitude of the centripetal force $F_c=mR\omega^2$ (this is equivalent to saying that $F_c=mv^2/R$ since $v=r\omega$ in circular motion) must be equal to the magnitude of the gravitational attraction to obtain \begin{equation*}
mR\omega^2=GMm/R^2
\end{equation*}
 and then rearrange to show that
 \begin{equation*}
{R={(GM/w^2)}^{1/3}.}
\end{equation*} 
Finally use $\omega$ corresponding to the angular speed of Earth's rotation about its axis to find the numerical answer, which is $4.2\times 10^7$m.}
