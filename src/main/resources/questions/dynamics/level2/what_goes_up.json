    "value": "The correct answer is (b). The kinetic energy is zero at the maximum height attained, momentum is only conserved when no external forces such as gravity act, the speed is not constant so the distances in equal times are not the same, and the potential energy increases uniformly with height but quadratically with time. Thus the statement about conservation of energy is the only correct one, and indeed the sum of kinetic and potential energy will be constant if there is no air resistance.",
