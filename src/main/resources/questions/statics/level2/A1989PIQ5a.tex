{\exposition{A nail is embedded into a wooden post. A cord is used to pull the nail out; it is attached to the head of the nail and pulls at an angle of 30$^{\circ}$ to the post with a tension of 50 N.} \question{What is the force tending to pull the nail out of the post?}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \choice[a]{$50\cos{30^{\circ}}$}
	\item  \choice[b]{$50\sin{30^{\circ}}$}\correct
	\item  \choice[c]{$50\tan{30^{\circ}}$}
	\item  \choice[d]{$50/\cos{30^{\circ}}$}
	\item  \choice[e]{$50/\sin{30^{\circ}}$}
\end{enumerate}

{\answer{The correct answer is (b).} As is Figure \ref{fig:Statics_force_nail}, to take the horizontal component of the tension, multiply by $\sin{30^{\circ}}$.
