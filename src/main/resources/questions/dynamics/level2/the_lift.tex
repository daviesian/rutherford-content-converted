\begin{problem}[HE+_Lift]% Needs N2L, a little SUVAT and Work.
{A lift, of  mass \vari{m}, is travelling downwards at a speed \vari{u}. It is brought to rest by a constant acceleration over a distance \vari{h}. 
\begin{enumerate} 
	\item What is the tension, \vari{T}, in the lift cable when the lift is stopping?
	\item What is the work done by the tension whilst stopping the lift?
\end{enumerate}
%\item A lift, of mass $m$, is travelling upwards at a speed $u$. It is brought to rest by a constant acceleration over a distance h.

	%\item What is the tension, $T$, in the lift cable when the lift is stopping?
	%\item What is the work done by the tension whilst stopping the lift?

%NB: For the website, we are planning to have these two questions alternate at random. When a student clicks on the question he could receive either part a) or part b).

{\begin{enumerate}
\item
\begin{enumerate}
	\item This part has two steps; find the acceleration, then find the force. We can use the SUVAT equations to find the acceleration; the equation \valuedef{v^{2}}{u^{2} + 2as}{} is the one required here. We have \valuedef{v}{0}{m\,s\sup{-1}}, \valuedef{u}{u}{} and \valuedef{s}{h}{}:
\begin{align*} 
a &= \frac{v^{2} - u^{2}}{2s} \\ 
&= -\frac{u^{2}}{2h} 
\end{align*}
And then by considering the total downward force we can find \vari{T}:
\begin{align*} 
F &= (mg - T) \\ 
&= ma = -\frac{mu^{2}}{2h} 
\end{align*}
or, rearranging 
\begin{align*} 
T &= mg - ma \\ 
&= mg + \frac{mu^{2}}{2h} 
\end{align*}
	\item The work done by the tension is the force multiplied by the distance travelled in the direction the force acts: \vari{W} = \valuedef{\vtr{F}\cdot\vtr{d}}{-Th}{} (as the tension acts in the opposite direction to the distance).
	\begin{align*} 
	\textrm{Work} &= -Th \\
	&= -\left(mg + \frac{mu^{2}}{2h}\right)h \\ 
	&= - mgh - \frac{1}{2}mu^{2} 
	\end{align*}
and it should be clear this equals the total change in energy of the lift.
