    "value": "The impulse from a constant force is the product of the magnitude of the force with the time for which the force acts. Here it is important to realise that this is the change in momentum of a body due to an applied force. The law of conservation of linear momentum states that through a collision, the total momentum of all bodies is conserved.",
