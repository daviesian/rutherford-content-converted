\end{wrapfigure}
Figure \ref{fig:circular} shows a circle of radius \vari{a} with an arc of length $l$ subtending angle \vari{\theta} at the centre.  Thus \vari{\theta} is the angle between the radii going to the ends of the arc. Arc length, radius and angle are connected by \vari{l = a \theta}.  The angle in radians is \vari{\theta = l/a}.  A differential length is connected to a differential angle similarly: \vari{\d l = a \d \theta}.\nll
The angle increases at rate \vari{\omega = \d \theta / \d t}, with \vari{\omega} the angular frequency or speed in radians per second.  The above gives us \vari{v = \d l/\d t = a \d \theta/\d t = a \omega}.  Thus the speed around the circle and the angular frequency are related by:
\begin{equation*} 
 v = a \omega \;\;\; \textrm{or} \;\;\;  \omega = v/a.
\end{equation*}  
The direction of the velocity is tangential.  The units of \vari{\omega} are s\sup{-1}, radians being dimensionless.
\nll
For constant angular speed, the angle is \vari{\theta = \omega t} in time \vari{t}.\\
The period \vari{T} is the time taken to traverse one revolution or\\
one cycle: \valuedef{\theta}{0}{}$\rightarrow$ \valuedef{\theta}{2\pi}{}.\\
Thus \valuedef{2\pi}{\omega T}{} and hence:  \valuedef{\omega}{2\pi/T}{} or \valuedef{T}{2\pi/\omega}{}.

\section{Circular dynamics}
In circular motion the direction of motion is tangential and always changing; figure \ref{fig:centripetal}.
The speed is constant.  The force required to change the velocity, and hence the momentum is always to the centre of the circle and perpendicular to the motion.  This \stress{centripetal} force does no work.  The energy of the particle is unchanging.  Note that the velocity and thus momentum has reversed direction between the points 1 (at the top of the circle) and 3 (at the bottom of the circle) as a result of the continuing action of the centripetal force.\nll
Figure~\ref{fig:centripetal-derive} shows the velocity changing in a time $\d t$.
The difference between the velocities, \vari{\d \vtr{v}}, points inwards --- see the vector triangle.  Since \vari{\vtr{v}} and \vari{\vtr{v}'} are of the same length and \vari{\d\vtr{v}} is small, once can think of the latter as an arc of a circle of radius \vari{v} and thus \vari{\d\vtr{v}} has length \vari{v \d\theta}.  The acceleration is inwards and of magnitude:  \begin{equation*} a = \d v/\d t = v \d\theta/\d t = v \omega .
\end{equation*}
Since \valuedef{v}{\omega r}{},  we have two equivalent expressions for the \stress{centripetal} (inward) acceleration \vari{a}:
\begin{equation*} a = v^2/r \equiv  \omega^2 r .
\end{equation*}
