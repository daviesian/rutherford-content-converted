\begin{problem}[Robin8]
\exposition{A rocket similar to that which launches NASAâ€™s space shuttle into a low earth orbit has a take-off mass of \quantity{2000}{tonnes} (\quantity{1}{tonne}$ =  1\times$ \quantity{10^3}{kg}) and provides a thrust at take-off of \quantity{24}{MN} (\quantity{1}{MN}$ = 1\times$\quantity{10^6}{N}). The thrust remains constant and \valuedef{g}{10}{m\,s\sup{-2}}.  Air resistance can be neglected at take-off. }
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \question[a]{Sketch a diagram of the rocket and mark on the forces acting during take-off.}
	\item \question[b]{Calculate the acceleration of the rocket at take-off.}
	\item \question[c]{What fraction of the acceleration due to gravity (\vari{g}) is this?}
	\item \question[d]{To reach orbit, the shuttle has to achieve a speed of \quantity{8}{km\,s\sup{-1}}.  How long would this take with this acceleration?}
	\item \question[e]{The fuel is burnt off at the rate of \quantity{4.0}{tonnes} each second.  For how long can the engines provide the thrust?}
	\item \question[f]{What simple explanation is there for the large difference in the two times that you have calculated in (4.) and (5.) for the shuttle to reach orbit?}
