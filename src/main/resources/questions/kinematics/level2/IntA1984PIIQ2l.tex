\begin{problem}[IntA1984PIIQ2l] 
{In the absence of air resistance, a stone is thrown from $P$ and follows a parabolic path. The highest point reached is $T$. The vertical component of acceleration of the stone
\begin{enumerate}
	\item is zero at $T$.
	\item is greatest at $T$.
	\item is greatest at $P$
	\item is the same at $P$ as at $T$.
	\item decreases at a constant rate.
\end{enumerate}
}

{The correct answer is (d). The acceleration due to gravity, $g$, is the same at all points during the motion.
