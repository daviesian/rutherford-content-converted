%\section{Resolving \& projecting vectors}
\subsection*{Projection \& resolution of vectors}
The projection (or resolution) of \vari{\vtr{u}} onto the \stress{direction} of $\vtr{v}$ is $u \cos\theta$, figure~\ref{fig:project-vectors}(a). The projections of  \vari{\vtr{u}} onto the coordinate axes, figure~\ref{fig:project-vectors}(b), of magnitude \vari{x} and \vari{y}, form an ordered pair \vari{(x,y)}.  This is called the coordinate representation or Cartesian form of the vector.  In the example \valuedef{x}{3}{} and \valuedef{y}{1}{}.
\begin{figure}[h!]

(b) The component form of the vector \valuedef{\vtr{u}}{(3,1)}{} displaying its projection on the \vari{x} and \vari{y} axes. (c) Work done by the motion of the point of application of the force \vari{\vtr{f}} along the direction of \vari{\vtr{d}}. (d) The coordinate axes are in effect (unit) vectors themselves, conventionally called \vari{\vtr{i}}, \vari{\vtr{j}}, . . . A vector \vari{\vtr{u}} can be thought of as being made up of these coordinate axis unit vectors but with magnitude being the projection of \vari{\vtr{u}} along each one. }\label{fig:project-vectors}

\subsubsection*{Quick Question}
\qq{What is the angle $\theta$ in the figure?  Give other equivalent forms for $\theta$.}{\valuedef{\theta}{\arctan(1/3)}{}.  }
\subsection*{Modulus, magnitude, or length of vectors; unit vectors}
Pythagoras in figure~\ref{fig:project-vectors}(b) gives the vector's length  \vari{|\vtr{u}|} $=$ \valuedef{u}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}{}.
\subsubsection*{Quick Question}
\qq{Draw a 3-D set of axes \vari{x,y,z} and a general vector with components $(x,y,z) = \vtr{v}$, say.  By employing Pythagoras with suitable right triangles, find $|\vtr{v}|$.}{$v = \sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}$.}\nl
Unit vectors have a length $=1$.  Any finite vector can be made a unit vector by dividing it by its own length, for instance $\vtr{v}/v$ is the unit vector in the direction of $\vtr{v}$ and it has no units.\nll
\qq{What unit vector corresponds to that connecting the origin with $(2,2,2)$?}{$\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}(1,1,1)$.}\nl
\qq{Draw a unit cube with an origin of axes at 1 corner so that other corners are at $(1,0,0)$, $(0,1,1)$, etc.  
Satisfy yourself that vectors along edges between directly connected corners are unit vectors.  \nll
Give the component form of the vectors along face diagonals  from the origin to the 3 directly connected corners.  How long are they? \nll Give the vector going from the origin to the opposing corner along a body diagonal.  How long is it? \nll Give the form of the unit vector along this diagonal.}{$(1,1,0)$, $(1,0,1)$ and $(0,1,1)$, with lengths $\sqrt{2}$; to the opposing corner is $(1,1,1)$ with length $\sqrt{3}$ and unit vector $\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}(1,1,1)$.}\nll These exercises will be useful in calculating the effect of radiation from the Sun on objects.
\subsection*{The vector dot product}  
The work done by a force $\vtr{f}$ in moving along $\vtr{d}$ is $W = fd\cos\theta$, see figure~\ref{fig:project-vectors}(c): the distance actually moved, \stress{along the direction of the force}, is $d\cos\theta$ (i.e. the projection of $\vtr{d}$ onto $\vtr{f}$).  The work done, is this distance times the magnitude of the force.\nl
Work is the scalar (dot) product of the two vectors:  $W = \vtr{f} \cdot \vtr{d} = fd\cos\theta$. The dot product of perpendicular vectors is zero. Thus $\vtr{i} \cdot \vtr{j} = \vtr{j} \cdot \vtr{k} = \vtr{k} \cdot \vtr{i} = 0$.
\subsubsection*{Quick Questions}
\qq{If $\vtr{u}$ has projections $u_x$ along $x$, $u_y$ along $y$ etc., show $\vtr{u}$ is $\vtr{u} = u_x\vtr{i} + \dots$; see figure~\ref{fig:project-vectors}(d).  Show the dot product is $\vtr{u} \cdot \vtr{v} = u_x v_x + u_y v_y + \dots$.}{This $\vtr{u}$ has the correct projections along all the axes.  Some dot products of $\vtr{i}$, $\vtr{j}$ etc. are unity and others are zero -- write them out and see.}
