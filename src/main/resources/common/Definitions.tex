%Quantity is used for numbers with units: 1 kg, 1 m/s. Can be used as well to just write units, e.g.: \quantity{}{kg} -> kg.
\def\quantity#1#2{{${#1}$}{$\text{\,#2}$}}

%Vari puts a defined variable in maths font
\def\vari#1{${#1}$}

%Value is to be used when defining a variable with a quantity. If write \valuedef{m}{1}{kg}, it will display m = 1 kg. Can also use to have equations without units: E = 1/2 mv^2 would be \valuedef{E}{1/2mv^2}. 
%When to use units: if there is a number, place units at the end, after the final equality sign. Do not place them within an equation. If you need to place units within an equation environment, use \mbox{}, then the definition you want. Do not forget to place units after a zero, e.g.: t = 0 s. Units must be separated by \, at all times. Otherwise ms^{-s} could be understood as 'per milliseconds'. If you need to use an equal sign, you need to put it in maths mode otherwise it looks different on the webpage.
