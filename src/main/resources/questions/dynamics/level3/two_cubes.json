   "value": "Two equal sized cubes, X and Y, of masses \n$\\vari{m}$\n and \n$\\vari{2m}$\n respectively, rest on a smooth horizontal plane with a face of one cube in contact with a face of the other. They are accelerated by a force \n$\\vari{F}$\n applied to cube X, on the face opposite to that touching cube Y. What is the magnitude of the force exerted by block Y on block X during this acceleration?",
