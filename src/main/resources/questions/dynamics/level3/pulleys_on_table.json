    "value": "This step can be simplified by a realisation based on energy principles. When \n$\\vari{m_{2}}$\n hits the floor there is no longer any tension in the string, but the other two masses have momenta that will carry them onwards and make the string slack. But \n$\\vari{m_{1}}$\n now has a net force of \n$\\vari{-m_{1}g}$\n acting on it, which will slow both masses and reverse their motion. When they get back to the point they were at as \n$\\vari{m_{2}}$\n hit the ground, the string will go taut again. Since the surface is smooth the kinetic energy of \n$\\vari{m_{1}}$\n and \n$\\vari{m_{3}}$\n must be the same as it was initially; there are no losses to friction and the gravitational potential energy is unchanged. Thus the speed of \n$\\vari{m_{1}}$\n and \n$\\vari{m_{3}}$\n the instant the string goes taut must be the speed the masses were moving at as \n$\\vari{m_{2}}$\n hit the ground.",
