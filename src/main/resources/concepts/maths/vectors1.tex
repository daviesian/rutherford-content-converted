\subsection*{Examples of vectors}
Vectors have a magnitude (length when drawn) and direction.  Examples in physics, with the symbols often employed for them, include:\nl
$\vtr{v}$ velocity \nl
$\vtr{x}$ displacement \nl
$\vtr{E}$ electric field \nl
$\vtr{A}$ area \nl
$\vtr{f}$ force \nl

\noindent Quantities with a magnitude but not a direction are known as \emph{scalars}.  Examples in physics include: \nl
$m$ mass \nl
$U$ energy \nl
$T$ temperature \nl
$q$ charge \nl

%\section{Properties of vectors}
\subsection*{Direction of vectors}
Vectors are not generally tied to an origin, see
figure~\ref{fig:basic-vectors}(a) where there are several equivalent vectors $\vtr{v}$. A specific translation vector from the origin to $(x,y)$ is also shown ($\vtr{r}$).
\begin{figure}[h!]

\caption{(a) Several vectors $\vtr{v}$ drawn are actually equivalent.  A specific vector $\vtr{r}$ connects the origin to a point $\vtr{r} = (x,y)$ in the plane.  (b) Tip to tail addition of two vectors (c) Subtraction of a vector -- tip to tail addition of $-\vtr{v}$ to $\vtr{u}$.  (d) Many different vectors $\vtr{v}$ but sharing the same length (modulus) $v$. }\label{fig:basic-vectors}
\end{figure}
\subsection*{Addition and subtraction}
Traversing one vector and then from its tip traversing the next from tail to tip gives a resultant $\vtr{u} + \vtr{v} \equiv \vtr{v} + \vtr{u}$, figure~\ref{fig:basic-vectors}(b).  Likewise, one can think of subtraction as the addition of $-\vtr{v}$ to $\vtr{u}$ instead, giving $\vtr{u} - \vtr{v}$, figure~\ref{fig:basic-vectors}(c).  Thus $\vtr{u}$, $\vtr{v}$ and $\vtr{u} + \vtr{v}$ form a vector triangle.

\subsection*{Modulus or length of a vector}
The length, modulus, or magnitude of a vector $\vtr{v}$ is denoted by $v$ (that is, without the bold, underlining or whatever is used to denote a vector); see the radius of the circle in figure~\ref{fig:basic-vectors}(d) where all the vectors differ in direction but have the same magnitude $v$ (sometimes denoted $|\vtr{v}|$).

\subsection*{Specifying vectors by their components}
Draw in the $x,y$ plane the two vectors $\vtr{v}_1 = (1,4)$ and $\vtr{v}_2 = (4,1)$.
\qq{Show that the vector connecting $(4,1)$ to $(1,4)$ is $\vtr{v}_1 - \vtr{v}_2$.  Draw an appropriate, simple right angled triangle that would allow you to evaluate the length of $\vtr{v}_1 - \vtr{v}_2$.  What is$|\vtr{v}_1 - \vtr{v}_2| $? }{$3\sqrt{2}$}
