\begin{problem}[A1988PIQ4l]
{Two bodies, P and Q, of equal mass are travelling towards one another on a level frictionless track, with speeds $u$ and $v$ respectively. They make an elastic collision. At some instant during the collision, P is brought instantaneously to rest. What is the speed of Q at this instant?
\begin{enumerate}
	\item zero
	\item $(v - u)$ \answer
	\item $2(v - u)$
	\item $\frac{1}{2}(v - u)$
	\item $\sqrt{uv}$
\end{enumerate}
}

{The correct answer is (b). This can be obtained by using the conservation of momentum; the total momentum is $m(v - u)$ for all time, and if P has no momentum then Q has this total momentum and so the speed in (b).}
