\begin{problem}[Zephyr_dense_rod] 
{A rod of length $l$ and mass $m$ is pivoted around one end. It has non uniform mass per unit length, of the form $\mu = \alpha x$ where x is the distance from the pivot. Find the moment of inertia of the rod relative when around the pivot.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item $m l^2$
	\item $\dfrac{ml^2}{2}$
	\item $\dfrac{ml^2}{3}$
	\item $\dfrac{ml^2}{4}$
	\item $\dfrac{ml^2}{6}$
\end{enumerate}}
{Assume on the time-scale we're looking at, negligible new mass is accumulated by the disk}

The correct answer is (b).
Much like for the case of uniform density, to calculate the moment of inertia we have to sum up infinitesimal mass elements. The mass of an element $\delta m$ at $x$ of length $\delta x$ is

\begin{equation*}
\delta m = \mu~ \delta x = \alpha x ~ \delta x
\end{equation*}

Thus the mass of the whole bar is found by summing these mass contributions over the length of the bar

\begin{equation*}
m = \sum_{x=0}^{x =l} \alpha x ~ \delta x
\end{equation*}

As $\delta x$ goes to zero, the sum goes to a continuous integral, i.e.

\begin{equation*}
m = \int_{x=0}^{x =l} \alpha x ~ \d{ x} = \left[ \alpha \dfrac{x^2}{2} \right]_0^l = \dfrac{\alpha l^2}{2}
\end{equation*}

The moment of inertia of the mass element $\delta m$, is $\delta I$ where

\begin{equation*}
\delta I =  \delta m~ x^2 = \alpha x^3 ~\delta x
\end{equation*}

And again taking the sum as $\delta x$ goes to zero, i.e. the integral

\begin{equation*}
I = \int_{x=0}^{x =l} \alpha x^3 ~ \d{ x} = \left[ \alpha \dfrac{x^4}{4} \right]_0^l = \dfrac{\alpha l^4}{4}
\end{equation*}

and substituting our expression for $m$ into this, we find $I = \dfrac{ml^2}{2}$
