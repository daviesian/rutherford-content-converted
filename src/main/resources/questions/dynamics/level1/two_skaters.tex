\begin{problem}[Robin2]
{Two ice skaters on an ice rink skate towards each other and collide. It is useful to know what quantity is the same before and after the collision (conserved). In the collision 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The kinetic energy is conserved but the momentum is not conserved.
	\item The momentum is conserved but the kinetic energy is not conserved. \answer
	\item The momentum is conserved only of the skaters have the same mass.
	\item Neither the kinetic energy nor the momentum is conserved. 
	\item Both the kinetic energy and momentum are conserved.
\end{enumerate}
