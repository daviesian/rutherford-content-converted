    "value": "<p>\nThe correct answer is (c). This can be seen by considering the forces on the end of the spring before and after the string is burnt. Before the string is burnt the downward force of \n$\\quantity{(0.1 + 0.2)g}{N}$\n balanced the upward force from the spring, \n$\\vari{kx}$\n, i.e. \n$\\valuedef{kx}{2.94}{N}$\n. When the string is burnt, the upward force is still \n$\\vari{kx}$\n, but the downward force is now only \n$\\quantity{0.1g}{N}$\n; so a net force upwards on the mass attached to the end of the spring. The total force is \n$\\vari{kx-0.1g}$\n$=$\n$\\valuedef{0.3g - 0.2g}{0.1g}{N}$\n and so an acceleration of \n$\\valuedef{\\frac{F}{m}}{\\frac{1}{2}g}{m\\,  s\\sup {-2}}$\n. \n</p>",
