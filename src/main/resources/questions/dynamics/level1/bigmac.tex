\begin{problem}[Robin10]
{A Big Mac has \quantity{2.2}{MJ} of chemical potential energy which can be released by eating it. 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item How much energy is needed to lift a \quantity{50}{kg} student upwards through a height of \quantity{0.4}{m}?
	\item How many step-ups of \quantity{0.4}{m} would the student need to make in order to burn off the energy of a Big Mac?
	\item How many Big Macs would he need to consume in order to reach the top of Mount Everest, a height of \quantity{8}{km}?
	\item If the energy of a Big Mac could be used by itself to propel itself upwards, how high could it rise? (The mass of a Big Mac is \quantity{0.3}{kg}.)
\end{enumerate}
