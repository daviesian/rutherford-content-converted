Figure \ref{fig:circular} shows a circle of radius $a$ with an arc of length $l$ subtending angle $\theta$ at the centre.  Thus $\theta$ is the angle between the radii going to the ends of the arc. Arc length, radius and angle are connected by $l = a \theta$.  The angle in radians is $\theta = l/a$.  A differential length is connected to a differential angle similarly: $\d l = a \d \theta$.\nll
The angle increases at rate $\omega = \d \theta / \d t$, with $\omega$ the angular frequency or speed in radians per second.  The above gives us $v = \d l/\d t = a \d \theta/\d t = a \omega$.  Thus the speed around the circle and the angular frequency are related by:
\begin{equation*} 
 v = a \omega \;\;\; \textrm{or} \;\;\;  \omega = v/a.
\end{equation*}  
The direction of the velocity is tangential.  The units of $\omega$ are $\textrm{s}^{-1}$, radians being dimensionless.
\nll
For constant angular speed, the angle is $\theta = \omega t$ in time $t$.\\
The period $T$ is the time taken to traverse one revolution or one cycle: $\theta = 0 \rightarrow \theta = 2\pi$.\\
Thus $2\pi = \omega T$ and hence:
 \begin{equation*} \omega = 2\pi/T \;\;\; \textrm{or} \;\;\;  T = 2\pi/\omega .
\end{equation*}

\section{Circular dynamics}
In circular motion the direction of motion is tangential and always changing; figure~\ref{fig:centripetal}.
The speed is constant.  The force required to change the velocity, and hence the momentum is always to the centre of the circle and perpendicular to the motion.  This \textit{centripetal} force does no work.  The energy of the particle is unchanging.  Note that the velocity and thus momentum has reversed direction between the points 1 (at the top of the circle) and 3 (at thebototm of the circle) as a result of the continuing action of the centripetal force.\nll
Figure~\ref{fig:centripetal-derive} shows the velocity changing in a time $\d t$.
The difference between the velocities, $\d \vtr{v}$, points inwards --- see the vector triangle.  Since $\vtr{v}$ and $\vtr{v}'$ are of the same length and $\d\vtr{v}$ is small, once can think of the latter as an arc of a circle of radius $v$ and thus $\d\vtr{v}$ has length $v \d\theta$.  The acceleration is inwards and of magnitude:  \begin{equation*} a = \d v/\d t = v \d\theta/\d t = v \omega .
\end{equation*}
Since $v = \omega r$,  we have two equivalent expressions for the \textit{centripetal} (inward) acceleration $a$:
\begin{equation*} a = v^2/r \equiv  \omega^2 r .
\end{equation*}
