\begin{problem}[Robin6]
\exposition{A child of mass \quantity{25}{kg} sits at one end of a see-saw, \quantity{2}{m} away from the pivot.}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \question[a]{Where should her \quantity{60}{kg} parent sit in order to balance the see-saw?}
	\item \question[b]{If the child tips the see-saw very gently by pushing on the ground with her legs so that she rises by \quantity{0.4}{m}, how far will her parent fall on the other side?}
	\item \question[c]{How does the potential energy gained by the child compare with the potential energy lost by the parent?}
\end{enumerate}
