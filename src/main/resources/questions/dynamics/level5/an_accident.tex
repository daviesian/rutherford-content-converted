\begin{problem}[Phil_Car_Wall]
{A car has a mass of 1000 kg and an engine capable of outputting a maximum power of \quantity{85}{kW}. When this car is travelling at a speed \vari{v} it experiences a resistive force equal to \quantity{1.6v^2}{N}.

The car is travelling at its maximum possible speed when it smashes into a brick wall, which brings it to an immediate halt. What impulse does the wall exert on the car?
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \quantity{25700}{kg\,m\,s\sup{-1}}
	\item \quantity{37600}{kg\,m\,s\sup{-1}}
	\item \quantity{51400}{kg\,m\,s\sup{-1}} 
	\item \quantity{75200}{kg\,m\,s\sup{-1}}
	\item \quantity{230000}{kg\,m\,s\sup{-1}}
\end{enumerate}

{The correct answer is (b). At the car's maximum speed there is no acceleration, so the driving force is equal to the resistive force. $P = Fv$, so $F = \frac{P}{v}$; therefore $\frac{85000}{v} = 1.6v^{2}$. From this you can work out \value{v}{37.6}{m\,s\sup{-1}}. The correct answer can be calculated using impulse $= m\Delta v$.
