   "value": "A trailer towed by a truck has a length 0\n20\nm\n and has a mass 0\n3000\nkg\n evenly distributed along that length. There is a crate of mass 0\n2000\nkg\n sitting on the trailer at a distance 0\n5\nm\n from the back of the trailer. The trailer has a set of wheels at one end and sits on top of the back of the truck&apos;s carriage at the other. Assuming 0\n10\nm\n s\n-2\n, find the magnitude \n$\\vari{F}$\n of the contact force between the carriage and the trailer.",
