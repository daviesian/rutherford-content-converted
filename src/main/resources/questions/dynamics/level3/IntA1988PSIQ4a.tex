\begin{problem}[IntA1988PSIQ4a]  %Diagram removed.
{Two equal sized cubes, X and Y, of masses $m$ and $2m$ respectively, rest on a smooth horizontal plane with a face of one cube in contact with a face of the other. They are accelerated by a force $F$ applied to cube X, on the face opposite to that touching cube Y. What is the magnitude of the force exerted by block Y on block X during this acceleration?
\begin{enumerate}
	\item 0
	\item $\frac{1}{3}F$
	\item $\frac{1}{2}F$
	\item $\frac{2}{3}F$ \answer
	\item $F$
\end{enumerate}

{The correct answer is (d). This follows from Newton's Second Law, applied twice. Considering both cubes together, $\vtr{F} = m\vtr{a}$ gives that $F = (m + 2m)a$ so $a = \frac{F}{3m}$ and then considering just cube X, and calling the force Y exerts on it $R$, we have $(F - R) = ma = \frac{F}{3}$ and so $R = \frac{2}{3}F$.}
