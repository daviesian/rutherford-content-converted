\begin{problem}[IntA1988PIQ4l]
{Two masses, X and Y, are moving directly towards one another along a line. The momentum of X before the collision is 20 kg m s$^{-1}$ and the momentum of Y before the collision is 12 kg m s$^{-1}$. After the collision, the masses move in opposite directions and the momentum of X is 2 kg m s$^{-1}$. What is the magnitude of the momentum of Y?
\begin{enumerate}
	\item 6 kg m s$^{-1}$
	\item 8 kg m s$^{-1}$
	\item 10 kg m s$^{-1}$ \answer
	\item 30 kg m s$^{-1}$
	\item 34 kg m s$^{-1}$
\end{enumerate}

{The correct answer is (c). The total momentum in the direction X is moving in is 8 kg m s$^{-1}$ initially, so when X reverses direction and so has a momentum of -2 kg m s$^{-1}$; to make the total equal 8kg m s$^{-1}$ and conserve momentum, the momentum of Y must be 10 kg m s$^{-1}$.}
