\begin{problem}[Robin3]
{Two different masses are released and fall to the floor. If the air resistance can be neglected,
\begin{enumerate}
	\item the smaller mass falls faster than the larger mass.
	\item the larger mass falls faster than the smaller mass. 
	\item they fall at the same rate. \answer
	\item the speed depends on the shape of the mass.
	\item the denser mass falls faster.
\end{enumerate}
}
{\stress{Question by RWH}}
{The correct answer is (c).    If the masses are released from rest it is their acceleration that determines how fast they will travel as they fall.  The acceleration on these masses is just the acceleration due to gravity which is the same for both of them (as long as they are both on the same planet!) }
