\begin{problem}[Robin5]
\exposition{An \quantity{80}{kg} sprinter runs a \quantity{100}{m} race in \quantity{10.4}{s}. He accelerates to \quantity{9}{m\,s\sup{-1}} in the first \quantity{1.2}{s} with constant acceleration (this is a simplified model).} Use \valuedef{g}{10}{m\,s\sup{-2}}.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \question[a]{What average force does he push with to get up to speed?}
	\item \question[b]{What is the ratio of the accelerating force produced by his
legs to the weight of his whole body supported by his legs? }
	\item \question[c]{What distance does he travel in the first \quantity{1.2}{s}?}
	\item \question[d]{How much energy does he convert in \quantity{1.2}{s}?}
	\item \question[e]{What average power do his legs produce to accelerate him to his racing speed?}
	\item \question[f]{Since his legs can easily hold up more than twice his weight (he could easily lift a fellow athlete on to his shoulders) why is it that he cannot accelerate much faster at the start of the race?}
\end{enumerate}
