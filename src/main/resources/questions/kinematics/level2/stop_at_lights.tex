\begin{problem} [Phil_car_stoplight]
{\exposition{A car is travelling along a road at constant speed \valuedef{u}{7}{m\,s\sup{-1}}. The driver sees a stoplight ahead change to amber and applies the brakes. Consequently, the car experiences a total resistive force equal to \vari{\frac{1}{6}} of its weight and stops just at the stoplight.} \question{Taking \valuedef{g}{9.8}{m\, s\sup{-2}}, how far does the car travel during the braking period?}

{We are not told the mass of the car, so let's call it \vari{m}. The resistive force experienced by the car $= \frac{1}{6}mg$. Using Newton's second law, the car's deceleration is therefore $\frac{1}{6}g$. We can now use the equation $v^2 = u^2 + 2as$, where $v = 0$ and \valuedef{a}{-\frac{1}{6}g}{}(as the car is decelerating).
\begin{equation*}	0 = u^2 - \frac{1}{6}gs	\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}	u^2 = \frac{1}{6}gs	\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}	\Rightarrow s = \frac{6u^2}{g}	\end{equation*}
Substituting numerical values:
\begin{equation*}	s = \frac{6\times 49}{9.8} = 30	\end{equation*}
\answer{The car travels \quantity{30}{m} while braking.}
