\begin{problem}[A1988PIQ2l] 
{A stone slides across an icy surface and travels a distance $x$ in a time $t$, while undergoing a constant deceleration. Which of the following pairs of quantities would give a straight line graph when plotted to represent the motion of the stone?
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $x$ and $\frac{1}{t^{2}}$
	\item $x$ and $\frac{1}{t}$
	\item $\frac{x}{t}$ and $t$
	\item $\frac{x}{t^{2}}$ and $t$
	\item $\frac{x}{t^{3}}$ and $t$
\end{enumerate}
}

{The correct answer is (c). The SUVAT equation $s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^{2}$ gives that the distance and time are related by $x = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^{2}$; but this has two terms dependent on $t$ on the right hand side. Dividing by $t$ gives the equation of a straight line $\frac{x}{t} = \frac{1}{2}at + u$.}
