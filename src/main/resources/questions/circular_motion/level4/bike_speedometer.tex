\begin{problem}[A1984PIQ1l]
{The reading of a speedometer fitted to the front wheel of a bicycle is directly proportional to the angular speed of the wheel. A certain speedometer is correctly calibrated for use with a wheel of diameter \quantity{66}{cm} but, by mistake, is fitted to a \quantity{60}{cm} wheel. Explain whether the indicated linear speed would be greater or less than the actual linear speed and find the percentage error in the readings.

{The speedometer works by recording the angular speed \vari{\omega} and converting that into a linear speed using the formula \valuedef{v}{r\omega}{}. So by attaching it to a bike that has a smaller wheel radius the calculated linear speed will be too great, since the angular speed will be multiplied by \quantity{0.66}{m} instead of the actual \quantity{0.60}{m}. The percentage error is simply given by 
\begin{equation*} \frac{66-60}{60}\cdot100=10\% \end{equation*}
