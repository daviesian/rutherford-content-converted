{Two skiers want to reach the top of an incline without pushing. The first skier, of mass \vari{m}, reaches the start of the incline with a speed \vari{v}. He just makes it to the top of the incline. The second skier, of mass \vari{\frac{2}{3}m}, has a speed \vari{\frac{2}{3}v} at the bottom of the incline. Will she make it to the top without pushing? It can be assumed that frictional forces are negligible.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item No, she makes it to \vari{\frac{8}{27}h$ 
	\item No, she makes it to \vari{\frac{4}{9}h$ \answer
	\item No, she makes it to \vari{\frac{8}{9}h$
	\item Yes, she just makes it to the top
	\item Yes, she makes it to the top with a non-zero velocity
\end{enumerate}

%{An object of mass $m$ passes a point X with a velocity $v$ and then slides up a frictionless incline to stop at a point Y which has a vertical height of $h$ above X. A second object of mass $\frac{1}{2}m$ passes X with a velocity of $\frac{1}{2}v$. To what height will it rise?
%\begin{enumerate}
%	\item $\frac{1}{8}h$ %    - A new answer since it has 1/8th the energy. May confuse some.
%	\item $\frac{1}{4}h$
%	\item $\frac{1}{2}h$
%	\item $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}h$
%	\item $h$
%%	\item $\sqrt{2} \; h$   - The original answer

{The correct answer is (b). This can be seen by conserving energy; the initial \value{h}{\frac{v^{2}}{2g}}{} and the second height would be %$h_{2} = \frac{v^{2}}{8g} = \frac{1}{4}h$.
\value{h_{2}}{\frac{2v^{2}}{9}}{} = \vari{\frac{4}{9}h}.
 Motion where gravitational potential is the only energy loss is independent of mass, since the \vari{m} cancels out in \value{\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}}{mgh}{}.
% \\ \\ \\
%Initially $\frac{1}{2}mv^{2} = mgh$ or $h = \frac{v^{2}}{2g}$.\\ Using this, with $v_{0}$ and $h_{0}$ we obtain:\\ $h_{0} = \frac{v_{0}^{2}}{2g}$. \\ \\ When $v = \frac{2}{3}v_{0}$, we have $v^{2} = \frac{4}{9}v_{0}^{2}$. \\ \\Using the formula above, \begin{equation*}h = \frac{v^{2}}{2g} = \frac{v^{2}}{v_{0}^{2}}h_{0}\end{equation*} \\ From this it then follows: \begin{equation*} h = \frac{\left(\frac{4v_{0}^{2}}{9}\right)}{v_{0}^{2}} h_{0} = \frac{4}{9}h_{0} \end{equation*}
