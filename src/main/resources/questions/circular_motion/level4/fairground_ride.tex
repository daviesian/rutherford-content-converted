\begin{problem}[Nicki_Suggestion_Fair]
{A fairground ride consists of a rough cylinder that rotates about a vertical axis through its centre. Once people are inside and the cylinder is rotating fast enough the floor is removed but the thrillseekers do not fall down. If the coefficient of friction between the people and the cylinders is $\mu$ and the cylinder has radius \vari{R}, what is the minimum angular speed at which it needs to rotate for the ride to be safe?

{The forces acting on someone on the ride are shown in Figure \ref{fig:CircularMotion_h}:

The reaction force $\vtr{N}$ from the wall provides the centripetal force so
\begin{equation*}
N=mR\omega^2
\end{equation*}
for mass \vari{m}, angular speed $\omega$. In order for the rider not to fall, the magnitude of the frictional force $F=\mu$ N must balance the weight of magnitude \vari{mg}. Therefore
\begin{align*}
F=\mu N=mg \\
\Rightarrow \mu mR\omega^2=mg \\
\Rightarrow \omega^2=\frac{g}{\mu R}
\end{align*}
So the requirement is 
\begin{equation*}
\omega\ge\sqrt{\frac{g}{\mu R}}
\end{equation*}
