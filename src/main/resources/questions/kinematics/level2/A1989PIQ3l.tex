\begin{problem}[A1989PIQ3l] 
{A projectile is fired horizontally, off a vertical cliff of height $h$, with horizontal velocity $v$. Which of the following values for $v$ and $h$ will give the steepest angle of impact when the projectile hits the sea at the base of the cliff?\\

\quad\quad\quad $v$ / ms$^{-1}$ \quad\quad $h$ / m
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \quad\quad\; 10 \quad\quad\quad\quad\quad 30
	\item \quad\quad\; 10 \quad\quad\quad\quad\quad 50
	\item \quad\quad\; 30 \quad\quad\quad\quad\quad 30
	\item \quad\quad\; 30 \quad\quad\quad\quad\quad 50
	\item \quad\quad\; 50 \quad\quad\quad\quad\quad 10
\end{enumerate}

{The correct answer is (b). The angle of impact is the angle, $\theta$, the velocity vector makes with the ground at the instant the projectile hits. This means that $\tan(\theta) = \frac{v_{y}}{v_{x}}$, where $v_{x}$ is simply $v$ because there are no horizontal forces and $v_{y} = gt\s{impact}$. The time taken to hit the ground can be found simply using $h = \frac{1}{2}gt^{2}$ giving $t = \sqrt{\frac{2h}{g}}$, and so $v_{y} = \sqrt{2gh}$. This means that $\theta$ increases with $\tan(\theta) \propto \frac{\sqrt{h}}{v}$. The largest value of this comes from (b), and so it produces the largest angle of 72.3$^{\circ}$.
