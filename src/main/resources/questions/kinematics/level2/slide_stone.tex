\begin{problem}[A1988PIQ2l] 
{\exposition{A stone slides across an icy surface and travels a distance $x$ in a time $t$, while undergoing a constant deceleration.} \question{Which of the following pairs of quantities would give a straight line graph when plotted to represent the motion of the stone?}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \choice[a]{$x$ and $\frac{1}{t^{2}}$}
	\item \choice[b]{$x$ and $\frac{1}{t}$}
	\item \choice[c]{$\frac{x}{t}$ and $t$}\correct
	\item \choice[d]{$\frac{x}{t^{2}}$ and $t$}
	\item \choice[e]{$\frac{x}{t^{3}}$ and $t$}
\end{enumerate}

{\answer{The correct answer is (c).} The SUVAT equation $s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^{2}$ gives that the distance and time are related by $x = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^{2}$; but this has two terms dependent on $t$ on the right hand side. Dividing by $t$ gives the equation of a straight line $\frac{x}{t} = \frac{1}{2}at + u$.}
