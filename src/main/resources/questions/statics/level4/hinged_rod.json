The other end is freely hinged to another rod of length \n$\\vari{2a}$\n and mass \n$\\vari{m}$\n. Both rods are in equilibrium with the first rod horizontal and the second is inclined at some angle \n$\\vari{\\theta }$\n to the vertical with its unhinged end in contact with the rough floor. The coefficient of friction between the rod and the floor is \n$\\vari{\\mu }$\n. See Figure \n1\n.",
