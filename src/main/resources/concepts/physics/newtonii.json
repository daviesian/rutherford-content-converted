Let us consider, for example, a rocket in outer space that is burning fuel at a constant rate to produce a constant force of propulsion. Here, mass is being continually lost and the velocity of the rocket is continuously changing due to the resulting constant force - so we have both changing mass and changing velocity. \nThese changes are \ncontinuous\n continuous and therefore we can no longer represent Newton&apos;s Second Law in terms of large changes in time, \n$\\vari{\\Delta t}$\n , but instead have to consider how the mass and velocity change in infinitesimal amounts of time.
