   "value": "A rough wire is bent into shape such that it obeys the parametric equations \n$x=3p^2$\n and \n$y=2p^3$\n for \n$p\\ge 0$\n. The wire is then placed in a vertical plane such that the \n$\\vari{y}$\n-axis is vertical and the \n$\\vari{x}$\n-axis horizontal. A bead of mass \n$\\vari{m}$\n is then threaded onto the wire. The bead is then pulled in the direction of increasing \n$\\vari{x}$\n by a force \n$\\vari{F}$\n of magnitude \n$\\vari{3mg}$\n. The coefficient of friction \n$\\vari{\\mu }$\n between the wire and the bead is \n$\\vari{\\frac{1}{2}}$\n, find the set of points at which the bead can remain in equilibrium.",
