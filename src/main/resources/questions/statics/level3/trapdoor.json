It is held open making an angle \n$\\quantity{\\theta }{60$^{\\circ }$}$\n to the horizontal with a force of magnitude \n$\\vari{F}$\n at the open end acting perpendicular to the trap door. Find an expression for \n$\\vari{F}$\n and find the value of \n$\\vari{\\tan {\\varphi }}$\n, where \n$\\vari{\\varphi }$\n is the angle made by the line of action of the reaction force at the hinge above the horizontal.",
